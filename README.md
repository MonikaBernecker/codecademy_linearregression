# codecademy_linearregression
## About the Project
This project was conducted as part of a Codecademy course. The aim was to analyze data from professional tennis players to gain insights into factors influencing their financial earnings. Using data analysis techniques and linear regression, various aspects of player performance were examined to assess their relationship with winnings.

## Data Source
The data comes from the file tennis_stats.csv, which contains information about the top 1500 players in the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) from 2009 to 2017. The file includes service and return statistics (offensive and defensive aspects of play) as well as outcomes for each player for each year.

## Analysis
The analysis involved several steps:
Data Exploration: Examining the basic properties of the data, such as the number of entries, available variables, and statistical summaries.
Visual Analysis: Creating scatter plots to visualize the relationship between various playing statistics and the players' winnings.
Linear Regression: Employing simple and multiple linear regression to assess how well various statistics and their combinations can predict the players' winnings.

## Key Findings
The variable "BreakPointsOpportunities" proved to be a strong predictor of winnings, indicating the importance of breakpoints in tennis.
Interestingly, the number of "DoubleFaults" also showed a significant correlation with winnings, possibly through a negative relationship.
Combining technical aspects of the game with players' overall results (wins, losses, and ranking) led to a more effective prediction of winnings.
The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the financial success of professional tennis players, highlighting the importance of a balanced combination of technical skills and match outcomes.
